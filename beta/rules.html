        <h2>Welcome to the Rules Page</h2>
        <p>1. I kindly ask you to complete your assignments fully and with maximum effort, as your progress in the language mutually depends on our common efforts and contributions. Otherwise, I cannot guarantee any noticable results and at the same time I preserve the right to stop conducting classes.</p>
        <p>2. SYSTEMATIC revision and review of previously learned material is obligatory, even if I do not remind you about it during the class. Learning new words and regular revision is the key to success and a great way to avoid vocabulary loss.</p>
        <p>3. If, for any reason, you want to stop taking class with me or plan a vacation or a break, I kindly ask you to inform me no later than TWO WEEKS in advance. If you inform me too late, I will have to count the classes as conducted during those two weeks. I kidly ask you to respect this rule, as my income depends on classes conducted. More than that, during your vacation or break, I can invite other students from the waiting list.</p>
        <p>4. If you need to cancel a class or classes, I ask you to inform me NO LATER than 4-5 hours before the scheduled class time (the evening before the class would be a perfect time). Otherwise, the class must be fully paid.</p>
        <p>5. Rarely, I may cancel or reschedule a class for another time which is convenient for both of us. If I cancel the class, it will NOT be charged.</p>
        <p>6. In order to attend my classes you need a subscription which is to be paid ONE MONTH in advance transferring money to the my deposit card (details of which I will provide in a private message). The payment should be done ON THE LAST DAY of the previous subscription or BEFORE the first class. If payment is not done by the specified time, I reserve the right to stop conducting further classes.</p>
        <p>7. If the subscription ends and you decide to take a break (which is entirely your right, and I fully understand it üòä), but you still plan to take more classes from me, I ask you to pay FULLY for the subscription on the last day the previous subscription in order to keep your time slot. Otherwise, I cannot guarantee that you can take classes at the same time or days.</p>
        <p>8. I also ask you not to be late for classes or, at least, INFORM me immediately by phone. If your delay is for a valid reason, I will do my best to make up for the lost time. If this is not possible, the class will last (depending on the time delayed).</p>
        <p>9. I kindly ask you to submit your assignment for review (or questions related to it) BEFORE 8:00 PM.</p>
        <p>10. If you have any wishes or requests concerning the classes, I am always open and ready to adjust our learning program according to your needs and interests. üòä</p>
        <p>P.S. I really hope for your understanding and respect of my rules which are created to make the process effecient and enjoable for you ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
